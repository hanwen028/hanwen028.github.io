I set up my own blog on GitHub and I am very happy. Blogging is now a happy thing. It’s no longer a daily homework when I was in middle school. My blog looks like a daily record, recording my emotions. I like to talk. I can talk with close friends. No problem all day long.

It’s a pleasure to have a place where you can put your own written text. When you put the text here, you can read it for yourself and have a memory. If you see what the post says, if you don’t write an article or record it, you will lose your memory and memory. There are true and false, and there are memories that I don't want to recall.
